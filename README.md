# SQuotes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.0.

## Description
Users can view quotes from other users and can upvote or downvote based on how they feel about the quotes. Users can also post their own quotes and others can rate their quotes too. This was to make me properly understand Angular topics including components, directives, Pipes etc.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
git clone https://github.com/sheillanjoroge/SqyQuotes.git cd Sqyquotes/ ng serve

## Known Bugs
Add for both small and large displays does not stick where they should. Makes it hard to add a new quote when quotes have been added and fill the screen.

## Technologies Used
HTML 
CSS 
Bootstrap 
Angular
